Zero conditional is used to talk about facts or truths. The structure is:
If + present simple, present simple
For example:

If you heat water to 100Â°C, it boils.

If you drop an egg, it breaks.

If you don't eat, you get hungry.

First conditional is used to talk about possible or probable situations in the present or future. The structure is:

If + present simple, will + infinitive
For example:

If I study hard, I will pass the exam.

If you don't hurry, you will miss the train.

If we don't plant trees, we will have less oxygen in the future.

Second conditional is used to talk about impossible or unlikely situations in the present or future. The structure is:

If + past simple, would + infinitive
For example:

If I had a million dollars, I would buy a house.
If you didn't eat for a week, you would starve.
If we didn't have gravity, we would float away.
The third conditional is similar to the second conditional, but it is used to talk about past events that were not possible. The structure is:

If + past perfect, would have + past participle
For example:

If I had studied harder, I would have passed the exam.
If you hadn't forgotten your keys, we wouldn't be locked out of the house.
If we had left earlier, we would have avoided the traffic jam.
